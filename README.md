## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

    One challenge I encountered was figuring out how to customize the selection for the UICollectionViewCell because
    when I selected one cell, it highlighted the other cells in the same index path, too. To fix this, I decided to
    just highlight the cell rather than add a color for selection, which prevented the cell from selecting multiple
    cells.
